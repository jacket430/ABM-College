        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>Welcome to "Chemistry" class, where we explore the fascinating world of "special" cookie making! This course is perfect for those who want to learn the "art" of "baking" while "studying" the "effects" of our creations. Our lab is equipped with a toaster oven and some questionable ingredients we found in the back of the pantry.</p>
        
        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn to make "special" cookies using "alternative" ingredients</li>
            <li>Study the "effects" of our "special" cookies through "scientific observation"</li>
            <li>Develop "advanced" cookie making techniques (like using a toaster oven)</li>
            <li>Write a "research paper" about your "findings"</li>
            <li>Create a "presentation" about why your parents should be "proud" of your "chemistry" skills</li>
        </ul>

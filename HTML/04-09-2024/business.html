        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>Welcome to "Business," where we explore the complex art of paper airplane management and corporate silliness.

Through rigorous practice and analysis, students will master the subtle nuances of pretending to be busy while doing absolutely nothing.</p>

        <p><em>Note: This course takes paper airplane management very seriously. The college is not responsible for any sudden realizations about the nature of work, unexpected productivity epiphanies, or newfound appreciation for corporate nonsense. A willingness to pretend to be busy is required, but previous experience in paper airplane construction is optional.</em></p>

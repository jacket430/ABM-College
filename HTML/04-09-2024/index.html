        <h2 class="welcome-message">Welcome to Silly Goose College!</h2>
        
        <p>Silly Goose College is a completely made up, nonsense, gibberish school founded by a sphynx cat named "Bingus". You may be wondering, "Can a cat even run a school?", and if you're having that thought, that's heresy. Straight to Bingus-Prison with you.</p>
        
        <p>Our campus, located in the middle of absolutely nowhere, is more comparable to a warehouse than a school. The skylight is busted, and there's a horrible draft. All of the computers are also broken.</p>
        
        <p>At Silly College, we offer a wide range of programs across three main departments: Arts, Science, and Silly. The Arts program is more or less playing around with Kid Pix, but since the computers are broken, it's more of a discussion about Kid Pix. Our Science department is more comparable to an episode of "Breaking Bad" than an actual classroom. And our Silly classes are, well, SILLY! :)</p>
        
        <p>Beyond academics, we encourage our students to participate in various extracurricular activities, sports, and community service programs. We don't actually have any of those programs at the school, we just think it would be good for the students to go and seek those things out themselves. That's NOT our problem. It's YOUR problem.</p>
        
        <p>Join us at Silly Goose College, where learning meets fun, and where your academic journey becomes an unforgettable experience! Almost entirely for the wrong reasons!</p>

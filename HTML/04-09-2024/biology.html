        <p><em>Note: This course takes plant consciousness very seriously. The college is not responsible for any sudden realizations about your houseplants judging you, unexpected plant-related existential crises, or newfound paranoia about your garden's secret meetings. A willingness to accept that plants might be smarter than us is required, but previous experience in plant psychology is optional.</em></p>

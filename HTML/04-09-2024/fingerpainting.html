        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Advanced Finger Painting, where we explore the fine art of making a mess with your hands! This course is perfect for those who want to get in touch with their inner child while simultaneously ruining their clothes. Since we ran out of actual paint, we'll be using whatever condiments we can find in the cafeteria.</p>
        
        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Master the art of finger painting with ketchup (until we run out)</li>
            <li>Develop advanced mustard application techniques</li>
            <li>Create abstract art using mixed condiments</li>
            <li>Learn to justify your mess as "modern art"</li>
            <li>Write a 5-page essay on "Why My Parents Should Be Proud of My Condiment Art"</li>
        </ul>

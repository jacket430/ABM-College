        <p><em>Note: This course takes stick figure animation very seriously. The college is not responsible for any sudden realizations about the nature of digital violence, unexpected animation epiphanies, or newfound appreciation for flash-based entertainment. A willingness to analyze stick figure combat is required, but previous experience in animation is optional. Warning: May contain excessive stick figure violence.</em></p>

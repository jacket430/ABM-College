        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Nonsense, where we delve into the intricate study of meaninglessness and its profound implications. This course explores the theoretical underpinnings of nonsense as both a linguistic construct and a philosophical concept. Through rigorous analysis, students will examine how nonsense challenges our fundamental assumptions about communication, logic, and reality itself.</p>

        <p><em>Note: This course takes nonsense very seriously. The college is not responsible for any linguistic breakdowns, semantic crises, or sudden realizations about the futility of language that may result from taking this course. A willingness to embrace meaninglessness is required, but previous experience in existential dread is optional.</em></p>

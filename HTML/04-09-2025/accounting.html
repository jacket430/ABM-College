        <p><em>Note: This course takes creative bookkeeping very seriously. The college is not responsible for any sudden realizations about the nature of numbers, unexpected mathematical epiphanies, or newfound appreciation for accounting magic. A willingness to believe in the impossible is required, but previous experience in making numbers disappear is optional.</em></p>

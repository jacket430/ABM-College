Task 1:

Question 1:
5 definitions of IoT devices:

Oracle Canada: The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects, “things”, that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
IBM: The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, allowing them to collect and share data.
Amazon Web Services: The term IoT, or Internet of Things, refers to the collective network of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves.
Cambridge Dictionary: Objects with computing devices in them that are able to connect to each other and exchange data using the internet.
Trend Micro: The IoT can be described as an extension of the internet and other network connections to different sensors and devices, or “things”, affording even simple objects, such as lightbulbs, locks, and vents,  a higher degree of computing and analytical capabilities.

Question 2:
Identify the layers in a IoT architecture, 20 real-world examples for each layer.

Perception/Device Layer: The physical sensors, devices that actually take the readings. 
20 Examples:
Accelerometers
Air quality sensors
Cameras
Gas sensors (carbon monoxide, methane)
GPS receivers
Gyroscopes
Heart rate monitors
Humidity sensors
Infrared sensors
Light sensors
Magnetic field sensors
Moisture sensors
Motion detectors
Pressure sensors
Proximity sensors
RFID readers
Sound/volume sensors
Temperature sensors
Ultrasonic sensors (measures distance)
Vibration sensors (earthquake sensing, etc)

Network Layer: Handles transmission of data to be processed.
20 Examples:
ANT+ modules (wireless communication usually for fitness devices)
Bluetooth modules
CoAP (internet protcol for connecting devices to other internet protocols)
DASH7 modules (low power, long range wireless communication)
Ethernet controllers
Infrared modules
IoT gateways
LoRaWAN modules (long range, low power wireless communication)
Mesh network routers
Mobile/cellular modules
NB-IoT modules (narrowband cellular connectivity)
NFC modules
Power line communication modules
RF modules
RPL (low power/lossy network distance-vector routing)
Sattelite connection modules
Thread protocol devices (secure mesh networking)
Wi-SUN modules (wireless network for IoT devices)
Wifi modules
Zigbee modules (low power, low rate wireless communication)


Processing/Middleware Layer: Layer responsible for processing/analyzing data delivered from the "Network Layer".
20 Examples:

Remote food thermometers
Security systems
Smart lightbulbs
Smart power outlets
Smart refrigerators
Smart thermostats
Smart watches
Smoke detectors
Traffic monitoring
Vehicle monitoring and assistance
Waste management services
Water system management (usage, leaks)

Task 2:

Fingerprint Reader + Deadbolt: Connected/IoT deadbolt, includes fingerprint reader, remote unlocking, and wireless/tap keys in addition to regular keys.
Power Outlet: Smart power outlet, can be toggled remotely, connects to other smart home devices.
Smoke Detector: Smart smoke detector, notifies users and the fire department when it detects a fire
Proximity sensor: Component to be connected to a board, detects things in its proximity, variety of uses from security to manufacturing.
